# Data-manipulations-and-Regressions
Project in which I try to analyze various criminal and economic data gathered in 2 year intervals between 2010 and 2016. 

The 'Github' notebook contains the entirety of the code written for this project. 
'Functions' is a notebook containing only the functions for the code. 
'Github - clean' is a more cleaned up version of 'Github' that calls upon the external 'Functions' notebook.
